This is a demo Genetic Algorithm which might be of interest and a good starting point for anyone who wants to start working with Evolutionary Algorithms. Its based on Alasdair Turner's Processing code (http://www.openprocessing.org/visuals/?visualID=3101) slightly modified to work with OF --The algorithm attepmts to maximize the square of the side lengths while minimizing the overall volume on a population of cuboids. I 've added some comments to the code, describing the overall process. Enjoy!
